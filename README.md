### To Run

from root `npm install && npm run start` follow terminal commands to start in `web`

### Future Considerations

- Add testing
- Add additional bonus items
- Better styling
- Better commit history

## Challenges

My first react native application, there was a lot in the native API that was foreign and probably would have taken longer than given to learn, so the native implentation was written with web as the testing platform. For scale, a state managment tool would be ideal, or use native hooks to manage state. Both seemed a little over kill for this. Make the default drop down item, not clickable after the inital selection.
